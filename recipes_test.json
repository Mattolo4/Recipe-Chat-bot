        "output": "1. crust: mix until thoroughly combined - dough will be very stiff\n2. makes enough for two 12\" pizza pies\n3. the dough is ready to use \"as-is\" no need to rise or kneed\n4. divide the dough in half , shape into a round ball and roll out paper thin\n5. in order to move the crusts around a pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal works well\n6. after the crust , it's the sauce that begins the first real steps towards forming the total imo's pizza experience\n7. imos uses a tomato sauce mixture that has a sweet taste , but it's not so overly sweet to hide the rich tomato flavor or spices\n8. sauce:combine together and it's ready to use - do not pre-cook the sauce ! this makes enough sauce for about four 12\" pizza pies , so that should give you some idea of how much to use on each pizza\n9. on top of the sweet sauce imo's uses provel cheese , which is simply a blend of cheddar , swiss and provolone cheeses with some liquid smoke flavoring\n10. if you can't find provel in your local market , it can be easily created\n11. cheese:toss until cheeses and smoke flavoring are completely incorporated\n12. typically it's enough cheese for two 12\" pizza pies , but if you like extra-cheese you'll want to make more\n13. authentic imo's pizza toppings include: extra-cheese , onion , green pepper , sausage , hamburger , pepperoni , anchovy , bacon , black olive , mushroom , canadian bacon , jalapenos , pineapple , banana peppers , and tomatoes\n14. in a professional pizza oven the meat toppings can usually be put on raw , but at home you'll want to fully precook the meat before assembling the pizza\n15. now you have the correct style crust , sweet sauce , smoky cheese , generous toppings , it's now ready to be lightly sprinkled with some italian seasonings\n16. seasonings: combine all the ingredients in a small mixing bowl and blend well\n17. while in the restaurant the pizza is baked in a pizza pan , at home you'll have the best results using a pizza stone and an oven temperature around 450 degrees\n18. if you don't have a pizza stone , use the thinnest baking sheet you have and the lowest over rack position\n19. the pizza is done when the underside of the crust is a dark golden brown , and the cheese is has a slight golden tint to it\n20. underbaking the crust will result in a limp crust , overbaking will result in a hard , tough , burnt-tasting crust , getting the right baking time to produce a crisp crust will require a bit of experimentation\n21. the amount and type of toppings you use will also affect the total baking time\n22. a rule-of-thumb is to check the pizza after about 10-12 minutes and adjust baking time from there accordingly\n23. and , as a final touch to truly replicate imo's pizza at home , is to cut the pizza into tile-like squares instead of the traditional triangle slices"
