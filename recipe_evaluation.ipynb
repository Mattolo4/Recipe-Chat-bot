You will need to combine unsalted butter, sugar, extra large eggs, sour cream, vanilla extract, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, salt, baking soda, cream cheese, and confectioners' sugar. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Mix the butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Mix in the sour cream and vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking soda. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing well after each addition. Line a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper. Pour the batter into the pan.
